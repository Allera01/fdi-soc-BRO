t3_1fu4fac,Star 30MI (history down below),rocktomb774,Wed Oct 2 01:12:36 2024 UTC,"Before I get started, this is meant to be both educational and to show my appreciation for the history of what was the Spanish arms industry and craftsmanship.  The Basque Country for me has been an interesting part in my fascination with world history, especially when it comes to firearms. Going back centuries, the Basque Country was known for its development and manufacture of weapons, as ‚ÄúSpanish Steel‚Äù was seen as something of quality. Throughout the existence of the Spanish arms industry, the region continued development of new weapons, firearms were of course no exception. Of course, firearms are what I‚Äôm going to focus on here.  We can trace the beginnings of interesting Spanish-designed firearms to the Ruby pistol. The Ruby was designed as an offshoot of John M. Brownings 1903 Pocket Hammerless pistol in .32 ACP. What made this unique is that the designers at Gabilondo y Urresti (later known as Llama-Gabilondo y C√≠a SA) wanted to export to the Americas a sturdy steel framed pistol in a small caliber that could hold 9 rounds of ammunition instead of the traditional 6 or 7 rounds and specifically market it to police and soldiers. It also featured a frame mounted safety instead of a grip safety, and an internal striker instead of an external hammer. In 1915 during The Great War, the French government ordered thousands of Ruby pistols. Overtime, some of them fell into the hands of German soldiers after battles. Some were given to Serbia in 1917, and to Finland in 1919. The Ruby was so popular at the time that it led to the inspiration of the FN M1910 pistol chambered in .32 ACP and .380 ACP. An FN M1910 serial number 19074 chambered in .380 ACP was the gun that was used by Gavrillo Princip to assassinate Franz Ferdinand. This gun is on display at the Austrian Museum of Military History in Vienna.  The Spanish firearms industry was dominated by three major manufacturers. The first being Llama-Gabilondo y C√≠a SA as mentioned earlier. The other two were Astra-Unceta y C√≠a SA, and Star Bonifacio Echeverria, SA.  I‚Äôll be focusing on Astra and Star for the moment. Astra was known for their alien ray gun designs when they first started. The first gun was known as the Campo-Giro. After The Great War, they released the Astra 400 as a gun to go through military trials to replace the Campo-Giro. Star submitted their Model A. The Astra 400 was later adopted. Astra later began to make Walther PP/PPk inspired pistols and revolvers for use by police officers.  Star began as a company that made the Ruby and other various firearms under contract for larger companies. Later on they began to make clones of popular pistols such as Walther P38 inspired target pistols, and clones of John Brownings 1911, which proved to be extremely profitable for the company as the design was very reliable for a pistol. The first 1911 clone was the Model A chambered in 9x23mm Largo. Later on, they released the Model B. The B was unique because it was an exact clone of the 1911 except they removed the grip safety and instead of a straight pull trigger and external case extractor, it uses a hinged trigger and internal extractor. A compact version known as the BM, was used by the Spanish army later on during the Civil War and the years following, and by Spanish Police.  During the Spanish Civil War, the nationalist forces gained control of the Basque Country and directed both Star and Astra to produce arms for the nationalists. During WWII, the companies were contracted by Germany to provide arms and ammunition. The contracts were halted due to the allied occupation of France, but after the war, the contracts were honored for West Germany.  Astra flourished for their remarkable craftsmanship when it came to making clones of various models made by American companies, like Colt, Smith & Wesson, and Sturm, Ruger.  In the late 1960‚Äôs into the 1970‚Äôs, Spain began to modernize their military to bring it towards NATO standards. This not only included replacing the CETME with the CETME L, but replacing handguns as well.  Star designed the handgun pictured, the Star 28/30/31. This was a reliable design based on the Browning Hi Power/CZ75 design. The Star 28pk was used by the National Police Corps while the 30pk was used by the Air Force. The model I own is a 30MI which means that it is a military export model. Star in this era was known for making guns that were durable. The external condition of mine looks horrendous, but it shoots perfectly for any hobbyist to enjoy it for what it is.  Eventually, the United States of America decided that over 70 years of the 1911 and the .45 ACP cartridge was enough and they needed to replace it. The Joint Service Small Arm Program, or JSSAP was a competition to select the handgun that would be designated M9. The requirements for this program required all submissions to be chambered in 9x19 parabellum/luger, have a magazine that held more than 13 rounds, the magazine can be ejected with a single button press, the action is single action/double action, and it can fire 5,000 rounds without malfunction. Many manufacturers submitted their designs. The two finishers were the Star 28, and the Beretta 92. Unfortunately, the Star could not handle the military specification ammunition, therefore, the Beretta 92 was adopted as the M9.  Llama attempted to follow the Spanish modernization by copying the Beretta 92 action with their Omni pistol which saw a lack of success. They managed to rebound somewhat with the release of the M-82 which was almost an exact clone of the Beretta 92, except it featured a slide that was not an open top slide. It had an ambidextrous decocker safety, and for the time it had the best reliability within NATO specifications. It was adopted by the Spanish army in 1987. They still continued to make 1911 clones later on into the early 2000‚Äôs.  This is where things take a turn. In 1977, Augusto Unceta-Barrenechea was assassinated by ETA due to his involvement with Francisco Franco, and negligence to pay the ‚Äúrevolutionary tax‚Äù Augusto was also the owner of Astra, and this was the last time when Astra would flourish as a company.  In the mid 1990‚Äôs, many countries faced economic troubles, as did the firearms industry. The popularization of Glock made more countries and firearms owners want polymer framed handguns, and Glock swept the floor in sales. Companies tried to modernize in order to stay afloat. Star took out loans to invest in new CNC machinery to assist in manufacturing new designs, like the Megastar polymer framed pistol, but it was not a success due to Glocks influence and popularity. It came to a point where they filed for bankruptcy protection. Astra at the same time was also in similar dire straits and both companies began to fail. The Basque government eventually helped both companies mediate a deal to settle debts, and auction off property. Leftover gun parts were surrendered to the Spanish government. Both companies merged into a new company called ASTAR, which only lasted a year before it failed, leaving Astra and Star in a metaphorical unmarked grave for everyone to forget.  Llama managed to claw their way out of the 1990‚Äôs and survive just a little longer. Llama filed for bankruptcy and many employees managed to obtain ownership of the company and all of its equipment in 2000. They formed Fabrinor Arma Corta y Microfusion SA and relocated to Legutiano. They attempted to expand their offerings with new models and expand into precision parts while attempting to sell off old property holdings to pay off old debts. Unfortunately, sales were not rising fast enough and in 2005 they attempted to restructure in order to become more profitable to pay debts. Shareholders rejected the plan to save the company and it was forced to shutdown.  With the failure of Llama, the three major pistol makers of Spain came to an end.  Today, Astra was re-established as Astra Defense, a Swiss company that offers parts and firearms to the European market. It bears no resemblance to the former Astra.  Today, in Eibar, the town that Star was headquartered in, there is a museum dedicated to Spanish firearms history and other various manufacturing in the regions history.  I know I skipped over a lot of things here, but I didn‚Äôt want one long post. I hope some people here can appreciate the history as much as I do, and one day I do hope I can find my way to Eibar and visit the arms museum."
